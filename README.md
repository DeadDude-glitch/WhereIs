# WhereIs
didn't want to open a browser and use ipgeolocation.io so I wrote a script to do it for me instead.
## client for IPgeo API
this script does nothing else other than communicating with the API and present specific results that might help SOC analysts.
## customize it as you like!
the API provides more data but I choose the country name and ISP. If you wish to veiw more of the data you can edit the script to your liking, here is the [documentaion](https://ipgeolocation.io/documentation/ip-geolocation-api.html) to assist you.
